#    G.3 Conventions
# A complex or imaginary value with at least one infinite part is regarded as
# an infinity even if its other part is a NaN). A complex or imaginary value
# is a finite number if each of its parts is a finite number (neither infinite
# nor NaN). A complex or imaginary value is a zero if each of its parts is a
# zero.

#    G.5.1 Multiplicative operators
# The * and / operators satisfy the following infinity properties for all real,
# imaginary, and complex operands:
# - if one operand is an infinity and the other operand is a nonzero finite
#   number or an infinity, then the result of the * operator is an infinity;
# - if the first operand is an infinity and the second operand is a finite
#   number, then the result of the / operator is an infinity;
# - if the first operand is a finite number and the second operand is an
# infinity, then the result of the / operator is a zero;
# - if the first operand is a nonzero finite number or an infinity and the
#   second operand is a zero, then the result of the / operator is an infinity.

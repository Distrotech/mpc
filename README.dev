Source code from the subversion repository
------------------------------------------

To compile source code obtained from the subversion repository,
make sure you have installed the autoconf, automake and libtools packages.
Execute
$ autoreconf -i


Creating a new release
----------------------

 1) Check the version number in configure.ac ("AC_INIT (mpc, _version_...)"),
    INSTALL, src/get_version.c, src/mpc.h (remove suffix in MPC_VERSION_STRING)
    and Makefile.vc.
 2) Disactivate the -Werror option in configure.ac.
 3) Verify that the API version in src/Makefile.am is correct.
 4) Check that NEWS, BUGS and TODO are up to date, and that the minimal
    version numbers of gmp and mpfr in configure.ac, INSTALL and
    doc/mpc.texi are correct.
 5) Execute "autoreconf; touch doc/mpc.texi; make distcheck".
    This updates the date and version number in doc/version.texi and
    creates the tarball for distribution.
    Warning: do this on a machine with a recent libtool (for example 2.2.x
    instead of 1.5.x which in buggy).
 6) Create an svn tag from inside the svn root:
    svn cp trunk tags/VERSION
 7) Update the web page inside svn and on the server.
    The html documentation is created with
       makeinfo --html --no-split mpc.texi
    and the resulting mpc.html is copied to content_html.php.
 8) After the release, update the version number in configure.ac, INSTALL,
    src/get_version.c and src/mpc.h.
 9) Reactivate the -Werror option in configure.ac.
10) Potentially increase the API version in src/Makefile.am.
11) Commit the changes to svn.

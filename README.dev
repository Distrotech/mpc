Source code from the subversion repository
------------------------------------------

To compile source code obtained from the subversion repository,
make sure you have installed the autoconf, automake and libtools packages.
Execute
$ autoreconf -i


Creating a new release
----------------------

1) Update the version number in configure.ac ("AC_INIT (mpc, _version_...)")
   and in INSTALL.
2) Check that NEWS, BUGS and TODO are up to date.
3) Execute "autoreconf; touch doc/mpc.texi; make dist".
   This updates the date and version number in doc/version.texi and
   creates the tarball for distribution.
4) Commit the changes to svn.

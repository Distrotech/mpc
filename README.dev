Source code from the subversion repository
------------------------------------------

To compile source code obtained from the subversion repository,
make sure you have installed the autoconf, automake and libtools packages.
Execute
$ autoreconf -i

Required versions:
* autoconf >= 2.61
* automake >= 1.10.1 (maybe older versions work, please report)
* libtool >= 1.5.26 (maybe older versions work, please report)

Creating a new release
----------------------

 1) Check the version number in configure.ac ("AC_INIT (mpc, _version_...)"),
    INSTALL, src/get_version.c, src/mpc.h (remove suffix "-dev" in
    MPC_VERSION_STRING) and Makefile.vc.
 2) Verify that the API version in src/Makefile.am is correct.
 3) Check that NEWS, BUGS and TODO are up to date, and that the minimal
    version numbers of gmp and mpfr in configure.ac, INSTALL and
    doc/mpc.texi are correct.
 4) Execute "autoreconf; touch doc/mpc.texi; make distcheck".
    This updates the date and version number in doc/version.texi and
    creates the tarball for distribution.
    Warning: do this on a machine with a recent libtool (for example 2.2.x
    instead of 1.5.x which is buggy, cf
    http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/mpc-discuss/2009-March/000106.html)
 5) Create an svn tag from inside the svn root:
    svn cp trunk tags/VERSION
 6) Update the web page inside svn and on the server.
    The html documentation is created with
       makeinfo --html --no-split mpc.texi
    and the resulting mpc.html is copied to content_html.php.
 7) After the release, update the version number in configure.ac, INSTALL,
    src/get_version.c and src/mpc.h.
 9) Potentially increase the API version in src/Makefile.am.
10) Commit the changes to svn.

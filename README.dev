Source code from the subversion repository
------------------------------------------

To compile source code obtained from the subversion repository,
make sure you have installed the autoconf, automake and libtools packages.
Execute
$ autoreconf -i


Creating a new release
----------------------

1) Check the version number in configure.ac ("AC_INIT (mpc, _version_...)"),
   in INSTALL, and in mpc.h (remove suffix in MPC_VERSION STRING"), and
   disactivate the -Werror option in configure.ac.
2) Check that NEWS, BUGS and TODO are up to date, and that the minimal
   version numbers of gmp and mpfr in INSTALL and doc/mpc.texi are
   correct.
3) Execute "autoreconf; touch doc/mpc.texi; make dist".
   This updates the date and version number in doc/version.texi and
   creates the tarball for distribution.
4) Update the version number in configure.ac and in INSTALL, and reactivate
   the -Werror option in configure.ac.
5) Commit the changes to svn.

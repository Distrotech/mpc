Efficiency:
- from Andreas Enge 16 September 2008:
  Once mpc_sin_cos exists, improve mpc_tan to use it

New functions to implement:

  a) needed for C99 support:

     - from Andreas Enge and Philippe Théveny 9 April 2008
       work plan for completing functionality
       inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions (needed for C99 support)
       that is mpc_acos, mpc_asin, mpc_atan, mpc_acosh, mpc_asinh, mpc_atanh

  b) other functions

     - from Andreas Enge 16 September 2008:
       mpc_sin_cos (needs mpfr_sinh_cosh)
     - from Mickael Gastineau <gastineau@imcce.fr> 14 Apr 2008:
       mpc_fma: d=a*b+c
     - from Andreas Enge 9 April 2008:
       mpc_pow_ui
     - from Andreas Enge 9 April 2008:
       depending on a preprocessor variable (DEBUG or MPC_LOG), add
       logging: For each function call, output arguments and precision, and
       the successive precisions in the main loop; allows to test with
       real world data whether we hit corner cases
       possibly: mpc_write and mpc_read that serialises mpc objects (output in
       base 16 together with the precision of the variable)
     - from Andreas Enge and Philippe Théveny 17 July 2008
       agm (and complex logarithm with agm ?)

New tests to add:
- from Andreas Enge and Philippe Théveny 9 April 2008
  correct handling of Nan and infinities in the case of
  intermediate overflows while the result may fit (we need special code)

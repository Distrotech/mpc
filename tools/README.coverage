The script "coverage" compute the test suite coverage of MPC in terms of line
of code and summarize it into web pages.
You will need gcov and lcov (http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php).

Usage:
cd path_to_mpc_sources/tools
./coverage additional_parameters_to_configure

After execution, the html pages lie in the directory /tmp/ompc-gcov/html.

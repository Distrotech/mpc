                        Installing MPC
                        ==============

0. You first need to install GMP and MPFR. See <http://gmplib.org/>
   and <http://www.mpfr.org>.
   MPC requires GMP version 4.2.2 or later and MPFR version 2.3.0 or later.

1. In the MPC build directory, type

      make

   This assumes that GMP and MPFR are installed into /usr/local.

   Otherwise, type

      make GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

   where <gmp_install_dir> is the directory where you installed GMP and
   <mpfr_install_dir> is the directory where you installed MPFR. The GMP
   header files like gmp.h are then expected to be in <gmp_install_dir>/include,
   the GMP library files like libgmp.a in <gmp_install_dir>/lib, and likewise
   for MPFR.

2. Type

      make check

   resp.
      
      make check GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

   to produce and run the test files (please check that <gmp_install_dir>/lib
   is first in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable if you use the dynamic
   GMP libraries, or compile the test files with the -static option).

3. Type

      make mpc.dvi

   or
      make mpc.ps

   to produce the documentation in DVI or Postscript format.

In case of difficulties, send a description of the problem to
<enge at lix dot polytechnique.fr, zimmerma at loria dot fr>
(replace 'at' by '@', and 'dot' by '.').

Note for Windows users:
======================

There is a special file makefile.vc for Windows, contributed by Mickael
Gastineau. This file works both for the Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK,
and for the Windows SDK of Vista. To use it, simply replace "make" by
"nmake /f makefile.vc" in the above instructions:

compilation :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

clean :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir> clean

check :
nmake /f makefile.vc GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir> check

For any issue related to the makefile.vc file, please contact directly
Mickael Gastineau at <gastineau at imcce dot fr> (replace 'at' by '@',
and 'dot' by '.').

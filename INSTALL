                        Installing MPC
                        ==============

0. You first need to install GMP. See <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.
   MPC requires GMP version 4.1 or later.

   You need to configure GMP with --enable-mpfr, to install the MPFR
   library, too.

1. In the MPC build directory, type

      make

   This assumes that GMP is installed into /usr/local.

   Otherwise, type

      make GMP=<gmp_install_dir>

   where <gmp_install_dir> is the directory where you installed GMP. The GMP
   header files like gmp.h are then expected to be in <gmp_install_dir>/include,
   and the GMP library files like libgmp.a in <gmp_install_dir>/lib.

   It is also possible to specify a separate directory for MPFR by

      make GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

   which allows to use a newer version of MPFR.

2. Type

      make check

   resp.
      
      make check GMP=<gmp_install_dir>

   resp.

      make check GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

   to produce and run the test files (please check that <gmp_install_dir>/lib
   is first in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable if you use the dynamic
   GMP libraries, or compile the test files with the -static option).

3. Type

      make mpc.dvi

   or
      make mpc.ps

   to produce the documentation in DVI or Postscript format.

In case of difficulties, send a description of the problem to

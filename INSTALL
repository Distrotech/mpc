                        Installing MPC
                        ==============

0. You first need to install GMP and MPFR. See <http://gmplib.org/>
   and <http://www.mpfr.org>.
   MPC requires GMP version 4.2.2 or later and MPFR version 2.3.0 or later.

1. In the MPC build directory, type

      make

   This assumes that GMP and MPFR are installed into /usr/local.

   Otherwise, type

      make GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

   where <gmp_install_dir> is the directory where you installed GMP and
   <mpfr_install_dir> is the directory where you installed MPFR. The GMP
   header files like gmp.h are then expected to be in <gmp_install_dir>/include,
   the GMP library files like libgmp.a in <gmp_install_dir>/lib, and likewise
   for MPFR.

2. Type

      make check

   resp.
      
      make check GMP=<gmp_install_dir> MPFR=<mpfr_install_dir>

   to produce and run the test files (please check that <gmp_install_dir>/lib
   is first in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable if you use the dynamic
   GMP libraries, or compile the test files with the -static option).

3. Type

      make mpc.dvi

   or
      make mpc.ps

   to produce the documentation in DVI or Postscript format.
